# What's happening to Skork?
Skork is put on hold for a moment. I currently am developing a few applications 
in my final semester. I also have plans to remake what I currently have for
in WPF. I will be open sourcing the GUI application of Skork. However, Skork
will become a library which is not open-sourced. The GUI will only interact with
the Skork library. It acts as an engine and the open source GUI is what will be
open sourced for whoever to edit the layout, etc.

# What is Skork?
Skork is a custom programming language for writing a game with rules you define.
Skork allows you to test code in a visual way using sprites. This project is 
meant for the public coding community to browse and look at current Skork code.
Feel free to fork it and make any update/addition/deletion you want.

# Why the name Skork?
Typically when it comes to naming a project, I'm not very good at creating a 
good name. However, when it comes to this project, Skork is short and unique.
After saying it a few times, I found friends of mine find it easy to remember
the name. For me, that's enough. A unique name that people can remember. Did
I mention it sounds similar to Sprite? (the 2D character, not the lemon-lime 
beverage)

# Why is Skork open sourced?
This is a fantastic question. I usually like to create projects and horde the
code not because its great code but usually the other way around. I never created
an open sourced project before and after developing the random string generator,
I made a plan for my next project, whatever it is, be open-sourced. For the theme of
this particular project, pretty much creating a programming language would be a
huge task! Having it open sourced means others can contribute and add their code
and ideas to the project to make it more useful and better. Also perhaps teach.

# What is Skork useful for?
You can create a "game" with a ruleset you define statically or dynamically through
code. It provides an easy way to visualize a ruleset or function. It might find itself
being used in coding competitions for designing most simplest game and all sorts of stuff.
Since Skork is a major project, not all the design has been designed if that makes sense.
I know most of the functionality I want to kickstart this project with but not all of it.
