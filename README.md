# What is Skork?
Skork is a custom compiler for a custom script like language for a sort of game.
This description represents a prototype that is likely to be very different with 
each commit. The reason for that is because I understand what the interface will
look like but all the of intricate functionalities aren't completely thought out.

This project is meant for the public coding community to browse and look at
current Skork code. Feel free to fork it and make any update/addition/deletion
you want. *But remember to do all such activities **in accordance
to the current license.***

# Why the name Skork?
Typically when it comes to naming a project, I'm not very good at creating a 
good name. However, when it comes to this project, Skork is short and unique.
After saying it a few times, I found friends of mine find it easy to remember
the name. For me, that's enough. A unique name that people can remember. Did
I mention it sounds similar to Sprite? (the 2D character, not the lemon-lime 
beverage)

# Why is Skork open sourced?
This is a fantastic question. I usually like to create projects and horde the
code not because its great code but usually the other way around. I never created
an open sourced project before and after developing the random string generator,
I made a plan for my next project, whatever it is, be open-sourced. For the theme of
this particular project, pretty much creating a programming language would be a
huge task! Having it open sourced means others can contribute and add their code
and ideas to the project to make it more useful and better. Also perhaps teach.

# What is Skork useful for?
You can create a "game" with a ruleset you define statically or dynamically through
code. It provides an easy way to visualize a ruleset or function. It might find itself
being used in coding competitions for designing most simplest game and all sorts of stuff.
Since Skork is a major project, not all the design has been designed if that makes sense.
I know most of the functionality I want to kickstart this project with but not all of it.
